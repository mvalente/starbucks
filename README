Serverside Javascript Web Development Framework


INSTALL & RUN

Make sure you have jslibs installed. Run ./cimbali.js. Served
files should reside at /var/www/db by default. Create index.html
at that dir and access http://localhost/index.html to test



STATUS

- Barebones webserver running
- Answers both GET and POST
- Does basic REST/JSON database stuff CouchDB-like



TODO

- Implement CouchDB like APIs
- Move code from cimbali (appserver) to sical (dbserver)


2009/01/24

Added some changes to try and figure out the single POST
being accepted but no luck. Apparently the POST triggers
the 'readable' function twice, once for headers and the other
for the body.

2009/01/25

Now accepts multiple POSTs (and GETs) but if the 1st request
is a POST it will fail. Subsequent POSTs work OK. All POSTs
will work OK if there's an initial GET.

2009/01/26

Now does basic JSON/REST database stuff like CouchDB.
You can PUT to create DBs or JSON docs and POST to change docs.
You can GET to retrieve docs.

2009/01/27

Now moving current development (on a REST/JSON oriented DB) to
SICAL. Started implementing CouchDB database API
