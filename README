Serverside Javascript Web Development Framework


INSTALL & RUN

Make sure you have jslibs installed. Run ./cimbali.js. Served
files should reside at /var/www/db by default. Create index.html
at that dir and access http://localhost/index.html to test


STATUS

- Barebones webserver running
- Answers both GET and POST


TODO

- Accepts POST only once
 'wget --post-file=test.data http://localhost:8080/zbr0050' will
 create the resource which is then GETable. A second POST request
 like 'wget --post-file=test.data http://localhost:8080/zbr0051' will
 create the file and return it but it has no data (ie. empty)



2009/01/29

Added some changes to try and figure out the single POST
being accepted but no luck. Apparently the POST triggers
the 'readable' function twice, once for headers and the other
for the body.
