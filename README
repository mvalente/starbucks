Serverside Javascript Web Development Framework


INSTALL & RUN

Make sure you have jslibs installed. Run ./cimbali.js. Served
files should reside at /var/www/db by default. Create index.html
at that dir and access http://localhost/index.html to test


STATUS

- Barebones webserver running
- Answers both GET and POST


TODO

- Accepts POST only once
 'wget --post-file=test.data http://localhost:8080/zbr0050' will
 create the resource which is then GETable. A second POST request
 like 'wget --post-file=test.data http://localhost:8080/zbr0051' will
 create the file and return it but it has no data (ie. empty)
